# HFT-Market-Maker-Strategy
This repo details the development and benchmarking of a high-frequency market-making strategy implemented in the Bristol Stock Exchange, an agent-based simulation.

The original BSE documentation and code can be found [here](https://github.com/davecliff/BristolStockExchange)

The files with a numbering format, such as "11_Comparative_Trader_Metrics.ipynb", are the neat files used throughout the project. 

The final report, with results and discussion, is saved under "Report.pdf"
